KGBase: an autonomous biodiversity data management system.

Working on the study of biodiversity, the author of this repository faced a lack of simple and user-friendly tools for managing data on species finds. In my opinion, the biodiversity data management system has to be compliant with several requirements:

1. Autonomy: the core elements of the system should not be dependent on the availability of any external services.
2. Web-orientation: the system should allow for the presentation of data available on the Internet by standard tools.
3. Geo-orientation: Spatial data about the locations of finds (observations) should be presented in as much detail as possible.
4. Customizable: It should be possible to modify or supplement elements of the system according to current requirements and needs.
5. Modularity: parts of the system (e.g., data management of collection samples, literature, taxa, spatial data, etc.) should be independent and changes in one part should not affect the others.

Unfortunately, the available solutions that solve these problems are not known to me until now. For this reason, I have started to develop my own biodiversity data management system. Examples of using the system can be found on the developer's website: http://kgbase.ru.

The system is in a continuous process of testing and improvement. Unfortunately, the only developer of the system does not have enough time to continuously support the public code base and documentation. This repository contains some versions of the system that were used at different times. The current source code of the data management system can be obtained by e-mail at kgrebennikov@gmail.com (Konstantin Grebennikov). This software code is distributed "as is" without any warranties. If possible, the author will try to give necessary explanations about the system functionality.
